# Breaking DIY Bitcoin Signing Device

SeedSigner is a completely offline, stateless & air-gapped DIY Bitcoin Signing Device. It can be built using inexpensive, publicly available hardware components (usually < $50). SeedSigner helps users save with Bitcoin by assisting with trustless private key generation and multi-signature wallet setup, and helps users transact with Bitcoin via a secure, air-gapped QR-exchange signing model.
